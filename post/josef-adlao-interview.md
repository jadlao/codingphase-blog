### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

My name is Josef Adlao, I'm 29yo from Sydney Australia. 

### How did you get interested in programming?

I was doing a bit of freelance copywriting and made my own website by editing a premade theme, and enjoyed coding my own website more.

### When did you start learning to code?

I started learning in March 2017, while working a full-time job. Before that I had done a bit of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Mostly Codingphase, some courses on Udemy, and online tutorials.

### What do you love the most about programming?

Being able to create and build your own websites/apps and use those skills to be financially independent.

### What do you hate about programming?

Sometimes it can be hard to grasp the concepts and see the big-picture when it comes to the little details of things.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Not yet, but I've been on several interviews.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

So far I love using React for the frontend.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I'd like to go deeper into React and its new and advanced features like GraphQL. I'd also like to learn Ruby on Rails to use for my own projects (e.g. niche websites).

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years, I see myself living off my own niche websites and applications, with the freedom to choose whether or not to work at a company doing cool things.

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I'd focus more on getting the 5 projects done that Joe recommends, and just apply to jobs earlier.
